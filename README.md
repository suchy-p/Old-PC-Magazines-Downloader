# Old PC-Magazines Downloader
## Overwiev
This is pure hobby project. I'm interested in PC games from 90's and early 00's. Some time ago, there was a site called retroreaders, which aggregated many, if not all retro PC magazines published in Poland. 
Sadly, it doesn't exist anymore, but it turned out, that archivechive.org has many collections of these. Unfortunately, they are in disarray. These app was created to automate downloading of my three favorite magazines:
CD-Action, Gambler and Reset.
